## ⚠️ Content Warning

This project contains images generated under deliberately degraded conditions using adversarial generative models. The results may include:

- Severely distorted or missing facial features  
- Locally overamplified textures  
- Visual artifacts that can cause discomfort or unease

**You are advised not to view this content if:**

- You are under the age of 15  
- You have sensitivity to distorted or abnormal human-like images  
- You are experiencing stress, sleep issues, or are in a mentally vulnerable state  
- You are alone at night or in a dim environment

## 🧪 Project Overview

**Glitched Face** is an experimental visual archive based on intentionally misconfigured GAN training.  
A weakened discriminator architecture was used to observe emergent behavior in the generator.  
The resulting outputs deviated from normal facial structures and exhibit features such as:

- Mode collapse  
- Semantic fragmentation  
- Symbolic or spectral facial remnants

This repository is intended solely for visual reference and archival purposes. **No model weights or training procedures are provided.**

## 🧱 Architecture (Abstract Only)

The discriminator was purposefully weakened using non-standard convolution parameters (e.g., irregular kernel sizes, large strides).  
This led to failure in providing sufficient training pressure, encouraging the generator to learn unstable or symbolic features.

**Exact architecture and training details have been omitted.**
