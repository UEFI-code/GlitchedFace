## 🧪 Project Overview

**Glitched Face** is an experimental visual archive based on intentionally misconfigured GAN training.

The resulting outputs deviated from normal facial structures and exhibit features such as:

- Mode collapse  
- Semantic fragmentation  
- Symbolic or spectral facial remnants

This repository is intended solely for visual reference and archival purposes. **No model weights or training procedures are provided.**
